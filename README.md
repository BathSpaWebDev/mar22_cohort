# Web dev bootcamp - March 22

Welcome to the Web development bootcamp starting 7th March 22. We will use this repository to access your notes for the classes. There will also be recordings available for those that want to listen again.


## Starts from the basics

This is an intensive course, aimed at beginners. We realise that there are different levels of experience within the group -  this course aims to start from the very beginning, so you need to be prepared to go over content you may already know. This will deepen your understanding.

## A note on self-learning

Web developers need to be resourceful, and learn how to solve problems through logical thinking. While this course will aim to teach you as much as possible, you will only get the most out of the course if you combine teaching with reading online resources, documentation and tutorials. Throughout the course you will learn the thought processes of required to be a successful web developer.
