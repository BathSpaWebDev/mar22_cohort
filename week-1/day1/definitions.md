### What is a website?
A website is a group of globally accessible, interlinked web pages which have a single domain name. It can be developed and maintained by an individual, business or organization. The website aims to serve a variety of purposes. Example: Blogs.
A website is hosted on a single or multiple web server. It is accessible via a network like the Internet or a private local area network via IP address.

### What is a web application?
This is another term you will see a lot of, and is sometimes used interchangeably with website. The difference is that web applications are designed for interaction with end users, whereas a website basically contains static content. It doesn’t matter though - you just need to be aware of the term.

### What is a browser?
A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is application software for accessing the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.

### What is HTML, CSS and Javascript?
**HTML** is the markup (HyperText Markup Language) language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

**CSS** is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

**JavaScript** is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)


### Front-end vs Back-end
**Front-end **is the part of a website that the end user interacts with directly. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development.

The **back-end**, also called the server side, consists of the server which provides data on request, the application which channels it, and the database which organizes the information.
